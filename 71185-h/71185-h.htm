<h2 class="nobreak" id="ADVENTURES_OF">ADVENTURES OF<br>
UNCLE WIGGILY AND NURSE JANE</h2>

<p>Once upon a time Uncle Wiggily said to his muskrat lady housekeeper:
“Nurse Jane, we are going to the woods.” “What shall we
do in the woods?” asked Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, twisting her tail around
under her dress. “We shall visit the Squiggle Bugs, perhaps,” laughed
Uncle Wiggily, twinkling his pink nose. “And we may have an adventure.”
“You never know what will happen when you go to the woods,”
said Nurse Jane. “And, as you might get into danger if you went alone,
I will go with you.” The bunny rabbit and Nurse Jane hopped to the
forest. Suddenly Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy pulled Uncle Wiggily’s coat tails and
whispered: “See! There is a flat stump table, and on it are good things
to eat!” “Oh, yes!” cried Mr. Longears. “And, as no one is there, we
may as well sit down and eat the picnic lunch.” “What a large pitcher
of lemonade!” said Nurse Jane. “Whose is it, Uncle Wiggily?” “Maybe
it belongs to a giant,” answered the bunny. “Oh, dear!” cried Nurse
Jane. “Don’t be afraid,” said the rabbit. Nurse Jane felt relieved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp45" id="i004-2" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>


<p>Now, the stump table
had been set in the
woods by a Mother Bear
and her two little cubs.
Soon the three bears,
who had gone looking for
honey, came back. “Oh,
Mother!” growled Little
Cub Goopy, “someone is
at our table!” “They
are eating all our good
things!” whined Little
Cub Snoopy. Mother
Bear grumbled: “My
goodness!” “Let me crawl out on a branch over their heads, Mother,”
whispered Goopy. “I’ll drop acorns on that muskrat lady and bunny
uncle to scare them.” Mother Bear helped Goopy climb the tree while
Snoopy held her tail. A branch of the tree waved over the stump table.
Goopy climbed up softly.
Neither Uncle Wiggily
nor Nurse Jane heard
him. “This is a fine picnic,”
laughed the bunny,
eating a cake. Just then
Goopy, out on the end of
the branch, slipped and
tumbled into the big
pitcher of lemonade,
splashing it all over Uncle
Wiggily and Nurse Jane.
Uncle Wiggily hopped
home to his bungalow.</p>

</figure>

<p>“Where are you going?”
squeaked Nurse Jane.
Uncle Wiggily answered:
“I am going to get a piece
of sticky fly paper to
catch any more bears
that may drop down.”
With the sticky paper,
Mr. Longears hopped
back to the woods. He
put the sticky paper on
the stump table. Little
Cub Goopy, who had
scrambled out of the
lemonade, ran back to Mother Bear. “Now I will climb the tree and
scare away Uncle Wiggily,” Little Cub Snoopy whispered. So he
climbed out on the branch. But his paws slipped and down he fell
on the sticky fly paper. “Bless my pink, twinkling nose!” cried Uncle
Wiggily as he danced
with the big lemonade
pitcher. “Guff! Guff!”
whined Snoopy. The rabbit
pulled the little cub
off the sticky paper and
said: “I am going to tickle
you to make you a better
bear.” The bunny softly
patted little Cub Snoopy.
Then Uncle Wiggily balanced
his rheumatism
crutch on the end of
his nose.</p>

</figure>

<p>“Why are you doing
that?” asked Nurse Jane.
Uncle Wiggily danced
around as he answered:
“I want to make Mother
Bear laugh at this funny
trick so she won’t bite
us.” But Mother Bear
would not laugh. “Gurr!
Gurr!” she growled, pretending
to be angry. “I
think I shall nibble your
ears, Uncle Wiggily!”
“What for?” asked the
bunny rabbit. “For eating my little cubs’ lunch and for tickling Snoopy,”
replied Mother Bear. “Yes, I shall nibble your ears!” “Oh, no, you
shall not do that!” cried Nurse Jane. Then the muskrat lady took one
of the empty lunch baskets and slipped it over Mother Bear’s head.
“Now you can’t nibble
any ears!” said Miss
Fuzzy Wuzzy. “Ha! Ha!”
laughed Uncle Wiggily,
waving his paw. Little
Cub Goopy and Little
Cub Snoopy sat up together
like twins. “Wuff!
Wuff!” growled Mother
Bear as she sat down to
get the basket off her
head. Then the bunny
and Nurse Jane ran
safely home.</p>

<p>Next day Uncle Wiggily
arose early. “Ah, ha,
Nurse Jane!” he greeted
the muskrat lady. “Do
you want to go to the
woods and have another
adventure with bears?”
Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy said
she would rather have
different fun. “Then I’ll
tell you what we can do,”
spoke Uncle Wiggily.
“We’ll take our own
lunch and go visiting in
the forest.” Nurse Jane asked whom they would visit. “Oh, perhaps
the Squiggle Bugs,” answered the bunny. So he and the muskrat lady
went to the woods. “What are you going to do with the rope, Uncle
Wiggily?” asked Nurse Jane. “I am going to make you a swing,” politely
replied the rabbit.
He climbed a tree, fastened
the rope to a branch
and made a swing for his
housekeeper. “Up you
go!” cried the bunny, giving
Nurse Jane a push.
Up and down she swung,
and then she called: “I
wish I had a drink!”
Uncle Wiggily hopped
to the spring and filled
his tall, silk hat to
the brim with water.</p>

</figure>

<p>Nurse Jane thanked the
rabbit, drank the water
and swung by herself,
while Uncle Wiggily slept
under the trees until it
was time to eat lunch.
All at once the bunny
sneezed, and opening his
eyes, he saw a Squiggle
Bug tickling his nose.
“Look at Nurse Jane!”
buzzed the Bug. “She is
swinging too high!” All
of a sudden the swing
rope broke and down fell the muskrat lady. “Oh, I am so sorry!” cried
Uncle Wiggily. “Are you hurt?” Nurse Jane said she wasn’t. “I think
a hammock would be safer,” spoke the rabbit. He made a hammock
out of grass and cobwebs. “Get in,” the bunny invited Nurse Jane,
“and the Squiggle Bug
will pull you.” Suddenly,
while Nurse Jane was
swinging in the hammock,
the grass rope
broke and she began to
fall. Then a Giant Squiggle
Bug flew past and
caught one end of the
hammock. “Come here,
Uncle Wiggily!” buzzed
the Bug. “Don’t let
Nurse Jane bump!” cried
the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily and the
Bug let Nurse Jane down
easily. When the muskrat
lady crawled out of
the hammock she said:
“No more of that, if you
please!” The Giant Bug
flew away after Uncle
Wiggily had thanked
him. Then the little
Squiggle Bug said: “I
think you will have more
adventures on the other
side of the brook. I will
lead you to a plank bridge.” When they reached the bridge over the
brook the Squiggle Bug walked first. “I’ll go next to see if it is safe,”
offered Uncle Wiggily. After he had crossed, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy started,
but, as the muskrat lady reached the middle of the plank bridge, it
broke! Into the water
she splashed! The Squiggle
Bug tossed her the
end of a cobweb, and he
and Mr. Longears pulled
Nurse Jane out of the
water. Then, all of a
sudden as they were going
to eat the picnic
lunch, a Fuzzy Fox ran
away with the basket,
and Uncle Wiggily ran
after him waving his
rheumatism crutch.</p>

</figure>

<p>Uncle Wiggily ran after
the Fuzzy Fox. “I’ll get
you!” shouted the bunny.
The Fox ran fast but the
rabbit hopped faster and
took away the lunch
basket from the bad
chap. “I would nibble
your ears, only I’m out
of breath!” panted the
Fox. “Ha! Ha!” laughed
Uncle Wiggily. He
hopped back to Nurse
Jane with the lunch.
“Where can we set a table?” asked Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy. Along crawled
a big mud turtle. “We’ll set our table on the turtle’s back,” said
Uncle Wiggily. So they did. But, all of a sudden, as she sat down on
a toad stool to eat, Nurse Jane spilled some pepper on the turtle’s tail.
Away crawled the turtle
as fast as he could go,
spilling the picnic lunch.
“Oh, dear! How can we
get anything to eat?”
sighed Nurse Jane. “We
shall go visit Mr. Twistytail,
a pig gentleman I
know,” answered the
bunny. Mr. Twistytail
invited Nurse Jane and
Uncle Wiggily to dinner.
They had apple pudding
with sour milk sauce.</p>

<p>When Uncle Wiggily and
Nurse Jane reached
home, after having dined
with Mr. Twistytail, the
rabbit said: “I have had
enough adventures for
a while.” But the next
day there sounded a
knock at his door. “Some
one is coming to ask
you to go adventuring
again,” squeaked Nurse
Jane. Uncle Wiggily
opened the door and saw
Nannie Wagtail the Goat and Susie Littletail the rabbit. “Please make us
a playhouse,” begged the animal girls. The bunny made them a fine play
house with a chimney, a door, a window and everything. “And don’t let
any of the animal boys come to bother us!” bleated Nannie. “No, I won’t,”
promised Uncle Wiggily.
But a little while after
that Susie crawled from
the play house, outside
of which sat her doll, and
Susie cried: “Oh, Uncle
Wiggily! Please make
Billie Wagtail and Floppy
Twistytail stop teasing
us.” Suddenly the
teasing animal boys ran
in a circle around Uncle
Wiggily, laughing and
shouting with joy.</p>

<p>Around the play house
of Susie and Nannie the
animal boys ran next.
“Oh, please go away!”
begged Susie. “We can’t
have any fun with them
here!” bleated Nannie.
“Ha! I know what to
do!” laughed Uncle Wiggily.
“I’ll take these
boys to an ice cream
store and let them eat
as much as they please.”
“Come on, boys!” he
called, twinkling his pink nose. “Hurray! Hurrah! Hurroo!” shouted
Billie, Floppy, Tommie and Jackie, as Uncle Wiggily led them to the
ice cream store. “I want chocolate!” barked Jackie, standing on his
head. “Well, you must not tease the girls any more,” warned Uncle
Wiggily, and the animal
boys promised not to.
But, while the bunny
gentleman was gone, the
Fox and Wolf crept up
and frightened Susie and
Nannie. “Oh, where is
Uncle Wiggily?” cried
Susie. Suddenly the bunny
gentleman hopped
along with his bag of clubs
and golf balls. “I’ll scare
the bad chaps away!”
shouted the rabbit.</p>

<p>“The Fox and Wolf will
not bother you any
more,” laughed Uncle
Wiggily as he sent the
last golf ball flying toward
the bad chaps. “I banged
them on their noses!”
Nannie and Susie were
glad, but the goat girl
said: “I’m afraid they
might come back after
you go, Uncle Wiggily.
Couldn’t you move our
play house near your hollow
stump bungalow?” “No,” the bunny answered. “But wait a minute!
I have an idea!” Off hopped Uncle Wiggily until he met the kind circus
Elephant. “Will you please come and move a play house for me?”
asked the rabbit. “Right gladly,” replied the Elephant, standing on
his hind legs with his cap
on his head. The big,
strong elephant lifted the
play house up in his
trunk. “Where do you
want it?” he asked. “Can
you put it on your back?”
inquired the bunny.
“Yes, but tell the animal
girls to get inside the
house,” spoke the Elephant.
Susie and Nannie
hopped in and played
with their dolls.</p>

<p>Up in the air the Elephant
lifted the play
house with Susie and
Nannie inside. “Oh, isn’t
this fun!” bleated the goat
girl. “The most fun we
ever had!” laughed Susie.
Safely on his back the
Elephant set the play
house. “Now the Fox
and Wolf can’t get you,”
said Uncle Wiggily. “No,
they can’t,” answered
Susie. “But how can you
get up here, Uncle Wiggily” asked Nannie. “I’ll climb up on a ladder,”
replied the bunny. He put the ladder against the Elephant. But, as Uncle
Wiggily was climbing up, Susie cried: “Oh, here come the Fox and Wolf
back!” The Elephant laughed through his trunk. “Don’t let them frighten
you!” he rumbled. And
when the Fox and Wolf
came near enough the
Elephant picked them
up, one after the other
in his trunk, and tossed
them far, far away.
Then the animal girls
were happy. At the end
of the day the bunny
put roller skates under
the playhouse, hitched
his auto to it and
hauled it away.</p>

<p>Off in the greenwood
among the hills was a
lake of blue water. One
day the rabbit said to
Nurse Jane: “Come! We
shall take a ride on the
lake in my motor boat.”
Uncle Wiggily dressed
himself like a sailor, and
Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, carrying
her parasol, went
with him to the dock.
“Oh, may I come with
you?” squealed Floppy
Twistytail the piggie boy. “Let him come,” squeaked Nurse Jane. So Uncle
Wiggily, the muskrat lady and the piggie boy sailed over the blue lake
in the bunny gentleman’s motor boat. Now on shore were two bad
chaps—the Heavy Hippo and the Skillery Scallery Alligator with the
double jointed tail. “Let
us catch Uncle Wiggily!”
grunted the Heavy Hippo.
“That will be fun!”
rumbled the ’Gator.
“We can swim to the
island where they will
land, and catch them
there.” Uncle Wiggily,
Nurse Jane and the piggie
boy sailed to an island
in the lake. On the island
they played a game of
baseball. Oh, what fun!</p>

<p>After the ball game Uncle
Wiggily said: “It is
time we sailed on again.”
The piggie boy grunted:
“When do we eat?” The
bunny twinkled his pink
nose and answered:
“You shall soon have
something to eat, Floppy.”
Just then, from
where he was hiding in
the water near Baseball
Island, up rose the Heavy
Hippo. “Here is where
I eat now!” grunted the Heavy Hippo. “I’m going to nibble Uncle
Wiggily’s ears!” But the bunny was too quick! “Come on!” cried Mr.
Longears. He caught Nurse Jane by one paw, and Floppy by the other,
and, leaping from the island, jumped as far as he could. Uncle Wiggily
stepped on the Hippo’s
back and from there into
the motor boat with the
muskrat lady and piggie
boy. “Oh, what a surprise!”
howled the Hippo!
On puffed the motor boat
until Nurse Jane saw
another island. But Miss
Fuzzy Wuzzy did not
know that the ’Gator and
Hippo had swam there
and were having lunch
on this second island.</p>

<p>“Let us stop there,” said
Nurse Jane, as Uncle
Wiggily steered the boat
toward the second island.
“Are we going to eat
soon?” the piggie boy
asked. “I’m ashamed of
you—wanting to eat all
the while, Floppy!” spoke
Nurse Jane. Floppy
blushed red behind his
ears and grunted: “Well,
I’m hungry!” By this
time the ’Gator and
Hippo, eating lunch on the island, had seen the motor boat coming.
“You had better let me catch Uncle Wiggily,” bellowed the ’Gator. “All
right!” grunted the Hippo. The Alligator swam off under water and caught
in his teeth the anchor rope on Uncle Wiggily’s boat. “This time they shall
not get away!” rumbled
the Hippo. “I’ll hold my
mouth wide open and the
’Gator will pull the boat
and Uncle Wiggily right
in where I can nibble
his ears.” On swam the
’Gator pulling the boat
toward the big mouth
of the Heavy Hippo
which opened wider and
wider. Nurse Jane gave
Uncle Wiggily a hatchet,
crying: “Cut the rope!”</p>

<p>“Where did you get this
hatchet?” asked the
bunny. “I brought it to
cut kindling wood with
if we built a camp fire,”
answered Nurse Jane.
“But don’t ask questions!
Cut the rope!”
Uncle Wiggily raised the
axe and brought it down
on the anchor rope, one
end of which was in the
’Gator’s mouth. “Zip!”
snapped the rope. “Now
we are free!” cried Nurse Jane. “But the ’Gator is swimming away
with Uncle Wiggily’s rope and anchor!” squealed Floppy. “Let him
go!” laughed the bunny. “He doesn’t know we are loose. He thinks he
is still pulling us, and he’ll swim right into the Hippo’s mouth.” That is
just what the ’Gator did!
The Hippo closed his
mouth and nipped the Alligator!
“Wowzie Zow!”
howled the ’Gator. The
sharp anchor tickled the
Hippo’s tongue and the
Hippo sneezed. But Uncle
Wiggily, Nurse Jane
and Floppy were saved,
and this is the end of the
story. But there will be
more stories in another
book like this.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
